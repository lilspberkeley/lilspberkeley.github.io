    <p>The goal of this assignment is to take the digitized Prokudin-Gorskii glass plate images and, using image processing techniques, automatically produce a color image with as few visual artifacts as possible. There were two types of images - .jpg (smaller and simpler) and .tif (required image pyramid )
    I wrote code for both </p>
    <h2>Single-Scale Alignment</h2>
    <p>The Green (G) and Red (R) channels are aligned to the Blue (B) channel by searching for the best displacement within a specified window (e.g., [-15, 15] pixels in both x and y directions). The search is exhaustive, meaning that every possible pixel shift in this window is tested.</p>
